Required Update for New @types Library
The @types/googlemaps library that is installed in the next video has been deprecated. Instead, we need to install a different library:

npm install @types/google.maps

Also, you will still see a TS error in your code editor:

Cannot find name 'google'.ts(2304)

As the very first line in the index.ts file, you will need to add a triple slash directive:

/// <reference types="@types/google.maps" />
You can read about this in the official docs here:
